# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is my first Bootstrap Portfolio Template

This project uses 3 seperate coded HTML files to provide the user with information about the person, a page to display images of a project and working button links to said projects, and a placeholder for a contact form.

***This project still needs work/ de-bugging***
The current contact page is only a placeholder, and does not currently work to send contact information.

This Page is made with HTML, Bootstrap, and javaScript.
